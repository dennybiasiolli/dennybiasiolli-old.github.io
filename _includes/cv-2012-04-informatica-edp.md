## Software Developer at "Informatica EDP S.R.L.", Fossano (CN, Italy)

##### April 2012 - February 2016

Creation of management software in C# and Visual Basic.NET, using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013/2015 as development tool. These software use SQL Server and Access database. I also worked on interfacing with thirdÂ­party software via CSV files, Excel files, SQL views and stored procedures.

We use SVN for source control and to organize the development we rely on Mantis.

Crystal Reports 13 is the primary tool used for reporting, although lately we are attempting a migration to XtraReports DevExpress.

Activities:

* Software development in .NET for the waste management of companies that produce them,
carry them and / or they recover / dispose.

* Creation of modules to integrate the leading software for managing budgets, contracts, delivery notes, invoices, etc..

* Creation of reports with Crystal Reports 13

* Creation of reports with DevExpress

* Assistance and training to customers using the software, via phone, Skype or away at the customer
