It's from about one year that I don't write on my blog, last february I've changed my work and the time to spend on "extra activities" was little.

Fortunately my new work is very motivating, I couldn't ask better than that. In the last months I've tried a lot of technologies, more that in my entire career.

In the previous work we were focused only on Microsoft's desktop world, now with the help of [Ionic][ionic-home] and [Electron][electron-home] we are creating [Angular.js][angularjs-home]'s apps buildable on all desktop and mobile platforms with a couple of `npm run` commands.

Now I'm trying this platform, [Jekyll][jekyll-home], let's find out how it works!

In the next weeks my goal is to write technical posts about my work experience, hoping they will be useful to someone on the internet.

Stay tuned!
